# Digital Maker

This repository is meant to provide some helpful hints to Explorer (or Scouts) doing the final stage of the [Staged Activity Badge]([https://www.scouts.org.uk/staged-badges/): [Digital Maker](https://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/4283)

Explorers are most likely to want to go straight for the final stage of the badge and I felt some pointers (and a basic Git repo structure) might help in running such evenings. The rest of this README assumes you are a young person aiming to carry out Stage 5 of the badge.

## Part 1: Solving a Problem

_Identify a real-life local or global problem and design, build, test, and improve a solution by combining your digital making skills and selecting appropriate software tools, digital devices, components, and materials._

### Where To Start

The first step is to identify a real-life problem. Discuss with your leader for some ideas. Some suggestions:

#### Local

-

#### Global

-

### Design

Before you begin writing any

### Build

### Test

### Improve

## Part 2: Sharing a Resource

_Create and share a resource that would allow someone else to replicate your project with minimal previous knowledge. This resource should be digital, and it can be any format you like: a video (or a series!), an online (printable) document, an entry on a tutorials website such as Instructables, a blog post...Or meet with people who could benefit from your solution to share how you created it and explain how it can help them._

There are so many ways to share a resource online but here are a few expanded versions of the suggestions above:

### GitHub

In a professional or open source context many coding solutions from websites to scientific software. GitHub also provides free websites to projects hosted there.

### YouTube

### PDF

### Blog

### Sharing in Person

_During the current pandemic this could be done via video conferencing_
